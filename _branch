target: ItsyBitsy M4 Express - still current on branch exp-m-gg 01 August 2019

On branch exp-m-gg

'exp-m-gg' means it was generated directly from Branch master
(that's what the -m- is for, there).

Note that exp-ee was the last working branch; exp-ff is unknown status (don't remember).

Importantly, exp-m-gg is not a child of either exp-ee or exp-ff - master
got the benefits of exp-ee (through a short-term branch named 'develop'
which is usually deleted once a Release is made).
